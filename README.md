# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS

## npm run dev/preview to run

## Deployed at: http://cork-owl.vercel.app/

## Dev notes:
* ToDo: understand data flow and state management in Vue, this was a pure exercise in handling states and data locally.
* ToDo: The table expand row functionality could've been worked out by adding a new row to data on click and specially rendering it, but didnt do so due to         time commitments.
* Used Chart.JS to render the graph. Could not dive into docs in detail, due to time commitments and make it look exactly similar by adjusting the ticks in Y-Axis. 
* Overall this was a good introduction to Vue.
